## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Schema-first, one-module-then-replicate build order (GRI first, then 4 remaining)
- Roadmap: 4 phases at quick depth -- Foundation, GRI End-to-End, Remaining Modules, Cross-Framework Content

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Framework field schemas require instructor input for each of the 5 Zod schemas (domain knowledge dependency)
- ESRS 2025 "quick fix" revision scope needs instructor confirmation (which version this cohort uses)
- Case study data structure not yet documented in structured form
