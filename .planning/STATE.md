# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-24)

**Core value:** Students can accurately translate case study data into properly structured sustainability reports across all 5 frameworks -- with framework-perfect form schemas as the source of truth.
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Foundation and Application Shell

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Schema-first, one-module-then-replicate build order (GRI first, then 4 remaining)
- Roadmap: 4 phases at quick depth -- Foundation, GRI End-to-End, Remaining Modules, Cross-Framework Content
- 01-01: Used oklch color values from RESEARCH.md Pattern 2 for forest/earth/charcoal palette
- 01-01: Light mode only -- removed dark mode block per user constraints
- 01-01: Added src/env.d.ts module declaration for @fontsource-variable/inter to satisfy strict TypeScript

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Framework field schemas require instructor input for each of the 5 Zod schemas (domain knowledge dependency)
- ESRS 2025 "quick fix" revision scope needs instructor confirmation (which version this cohort uses)
- Case study data structure not yet documented in structured form
